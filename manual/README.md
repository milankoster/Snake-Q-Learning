# Manual Snake

You can run `manual_snake.py` to play the game manually. Use the arrow keys to play. The game functions identical to the Q learning variants, except that it is paused by default. 

The game inherits from `BaseVisualiser` to show the game using pygame. This in turn uses `BaseSnake` to run the game.
